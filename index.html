        <h2>Seriously, what the <span role="img" aria-label="Duck">&#129414;</span> else do you want?</h2>
        
        <p>You probably build websites and think your <span role="img" aria-label="poop">&#x1f4a9;</span> is special. You think your 13 megabyte parallax-ative home page is going to get you some <span role="img" aria-label="Duck">&#129414;</span>ing Awwward banner you can glue to the top corner of your site. You think your 40-pound jQuery file and 83 polyfills give IE7 a <span role="img" aria-label="eggplant">&#127814;</span> because it finally has box-shadow. Wrong, mother<span role="img" aria-label="Duck">&#129414;</span>er. Let me describe your perfect-<span role="img" aria-label="butt">&#127825;</span> website:</p>
        
        <ul>
            <li><span role="img" aria-label="poop">&#x1f4a9;</span>'s lightweight and loads fast</li>
            <li>Fits on all your <span role="img" aria-label="poop">&#x1f4a9;</span>ty screens</li>
            <li>Looks the same in all your <span role="img" aria-label="poop">&#x1f4a9;</span>ty browsers</li>
            <li>The mother<span role="img" aria-label="Duck">&#129414;</span>er's accessible to every <span role="img" aria-label="butt">&#127825;</span>hole that visits your site</li>
            <li><span role="img" aria-label="poop">&#x1f4a9;</span>'s legible and gets your <span role="img" aria-label="Duck">&#129414;</span>ing point across (if you had one instead of just 5mb pics of hipsters drinking coffee)</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h3>Well guess what, mother<span role="img" aria-label="Duck">&#129414;</span>er:</h3>
        
        <p>You. Are. Over-designing. Look at this <span role="img" aria-label="poop">&#x1f4a9;</span>. It's a mother<span role="img" aria-label="Duck">&#129414;</span>ing website. Why the <span role="img" aria-label="Duck">&#129414;</span> do you need to animate a <span role="img" aria-label="Duck">&#129414;</span>ing trendy-<span role="img" aria-label="butt">&#127825;</span> banner flag when I hover over that useless piece of <span role="img" aria-label="poop">&#x1f4a9;</span>? You spent hours on it and added 80 kilobytes to your <span role="img" aria-label="Duck">&#129414;</span>ing site, and some mother<span role="img" aria-label="Duck">&#129414;</span>er jabbing at it on their iPad with fat sausage fingers will never see that <span role="img" aria-label="poop">&#x1f4a9;</span>. Not to mention blind people will never see that <span role="img" aria-label="poop">&#x1f4a9;</span>, but they don't see any of your <span role="img" aria-label="poop">&#x1f4a9;</span>ty <span role="img" aria-label="poop">&#x1f4a9;</span>.</p>
        
        <p>You never knew it, but this is your perfect website. Here's why.</p>
        
        <h2>It's <span role="img" aria-label="Duck">&#129414;</span>ing lightweight</h2>
        
        <p>This entire page weighs less than the gradient-meshed facebook logo on your <span role="img" aria-label="Duck">&#129414;</span>ing Wordpress site. Did you seriously load 100kb of jQuery UI just so you could animate the <span role="img" aria-label="Duck">&#129414;</span>ing background color of a div? You loaded all 7 fontfaces of a <span role="img" aria-label="poop">&#x1f4a9;</span>ty webfont just so you could say "Hi." at 100px height at the beginning of your site? You piece of <span role="img" aria-label="poop">&#x1f4a9;</span>.</p>
        
        <h2>It's responsive</h2>
        
        <p>You dumb<span role="img" aria-label="butt">&#127825;</span>. You thought you needed media queries to be responsive, but no. Responsive means that it responds to whatever mother<span role="img" aria-label="Duck">&#129414;</span>ing screensize it's viewed on. This site doesn't care if you're on an iMac or a mother<span role="img" aria-label="Duck">&#129414;</span>ing Tamagotchi.</p>
        
        <h2>It <span role="img" aria-label="Duck">&#129414;</span>ing works</h2>
        
        <p>Look at this <span role="img" aria-label="poop">&#x1f4a9;</span>. You can read it ... that is, if you can read, mother<span role="img" aria-label="Duck">&#129414;</span>er. It makes sense. It has mother<span role="img" aria-label="Duck">&#129414;</span>ing hierarchy. It's using HTML5 tags so you and your <span role="img" aria-label="female dog">&#128054;</span>-<span role="img" aria-label="butt">&#127825;</span> browser know what the <span role="img" aria-label="Duck">&#129414;</span>'s in this <span role="img" aria-label="Duck">&#129414;</span>ing site. That's semantics, mother<span role="img" aria-label="Duck">&#129414;</span>er.</p>
        
        <p>It has content on the <span role="img" aria-label="Duck">&#129414;</span>ing screen. Your site has three bylines and link to your dribbble account, but you spread it over 7 full screens and make me click some bobbing button to show me how cool the jQuery ScrollTo plugin is.</p>
        
        <p>Cross-browser compatibility? Load this mother<span role="img" aria-label="Duck">&#129414;</span>er in IE6. I <span role="img" aria-label="Duck">&#129414;</span>ing dare you.</p>
        
        <h2>This is a website. Look at it.  You've never seen one before.</h2>
        
        <p>Like the man who's never grown out his beard has no idea what his true natural state is, you have no <span role="img" aria-label="Duck">&#129414;</span>ing idea what a website is. All you have ever seen are <span role="img" aria-label="poop">&#x1f4a9;</span>ty skeuomorphic bastardizations of what should be text communicating a <span role="img" aria-label="Duck">&#129414;</span>ing message. This is a real, naked website. Look at it. It's <span role="img" aria-label="Duck">&#129414;</span>ing beautiful.</p>
        
        <h3>Yes, this is <span role="img" aria-label="Duck">&#129414;</span>ing satire, you <span role="img" aria-label="Duck">&#129414;</span></h3>
        
        <p>I'm not actually saying your <span role="img" aria-label="poop">&#x1f4a9;</span>ty site should look like this. What I'm saying is that all the problems we have with websites are <strong>ones we create ourselves</strong>. Websites aren't broken by default, they are functional, high-performing, and accessible. You break them. You son-of-a-<span role="img" aria-label="female dog">&#128054;</span>.</p>
